# Story
You are a dangerous Virus/Bacteria and you want to intrude the body of your victim. There are multiple ways to get in, a sneeze or cough, through a cut or maybe sharing a glass? Doesn't matter, now that you're in the body you have one goal: spread yourself. In order to do that you must not only survive but also mutate to get stronger. The final result should be you completely overtaking the body.


# Roguelike
You have a certain amount of your cells, these cells you can divide into units that you must use to bring victory home.

## Round
Start will be a random cutscene explaining your entry point. Depending on that the "battleground" will look different. For example when being spread by a sneeze, you will start in the sinuses of a person.

Between rounds you can upgrade/mutate yourself
