go through training
only 25% survive -> are left with specific setup
are in the lymphatic system or the blood stream

-  every one is a bit different (have their own setup)
-  the right one locks onto the [[3. Dendritic Cell]]
-  if activated by it -> duplicates many times
-  then they decide:
	-  become memory cells and stay in lymph system
	-  Stimulate [[5. B-Cells]] to make antibodies
	-  Help [[4. Killer T-Cells]] develop
		-  and help on the battlefield by "motivating" the "soldiers" ([[1. Macrophage]], [[2. Neutrophil]] and [[4. Killer T-Cells]])
